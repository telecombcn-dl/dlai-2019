        "The convolutional operator works by sweeping the kernel filters through the input image. If we pool `x2` in a couple layers, from the 3rd convlayer onwards we have a `x4` smaller spatial resolution. This means it has to run through by far less pixels to process the whole feature map in those layers. Also, each feature occupies much less memory for the reduced resolution. Pooling is hence a practical downsampling to make our nets fit in memory, and also to get the salient features from the previous incoming feature maps (it gets the maximum activation and forwards only that one within a window). In general, for classification, it is usual to have pooling to condense spatial dimensions into less-and-more-abstract ones. This is done by finish processing the last reduced spatial feature map with some fully connected layer that mixes it all up."
